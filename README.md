### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Valerio Maglianella
I am from Italy and I guess not your typical coder! I am actually a Cognitive Neuroscientist (and Psychologist) finding my place in the AI world!

Besides open online courses, I attended an Advanced School in AI (350h+300h) and a Data Analyst course (240h) that allowed me to build a good foundation of Data Science and ML, applied to the domain-specific of brain/mind (computational neuroscience), but also domain-general. 

Currently improving on this and adding old and new projects here on GitHub! Open to suggestions, creative collabs, stimulating job opportunities.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
neuroscience, computational modeling, machine learning, data science, game design, escape rooms, archeology, mysteries, consciousness...
